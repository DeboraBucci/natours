# Natours

This project was coded by me, but was designed by `Jonas Schmedtmann` for one of his courses.

In the making of this project, I've learned to use SASS (using SCSS syntax) for making mixins, variables, nesting, etc., and a ton of new and fun different CSS features, such as 'backface-visibility', 'clip-path', and more!

I also learned about SASS' architecture, how to structure the code, and how to separate it.
